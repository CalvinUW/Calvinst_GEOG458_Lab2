## Twitter Search Discussion:

___Regarding your narratives about the exercise of the twsearch.ipynb, please introduce your research design. What topic you have chosen, how you pick the search terms as well as the search parameters.(POINT 9)___

The topic I chose to focus on was how the city of Seattle is talked about both in the city of Seattle, and other key cities in the Pacific Northwest. I thought that this would be interesting to look into, as the city of Seattle is often regarded in a political atmosphere, thus possibly being a polarizing figure in other places. Additionally, Seattle is the largest city in the Pacific Northwest, and thus likely impacts those people living in nearby cities.

**Search Terms:**
For my search, I decided that it in order to find out how people talk about Seattle, it would be most important to directly use Seattle as the sole search term. I had considered including additional keywords that may identify Seattle, but I decided it would be unnecessary, as Seattle does not have any major nicknames.


**Search Parameters:**

My searches were all done on Monday, January 16th at approximately 8 AM. These searches pulled tweets from up to seven days prior, thus forming a time interval of tweets from January 11th to January 16th. Since I wanted to see how major cities in the Pacific northwest talk about Seattle, I conducted my searches in four different geographical areas. The first area was the city Seattle, the second was the city of Spokane, the third was the city of Boise, and the last was the city of Portland.

**Comparison:**

Looking at each of the word clouds, one major similarity I think we see between all the different locations is the high frequency of words associated with Seattle sports teams, the sports teams of other cities, and sports in general. Another similarity between the word clouds is that each word cloud contains terms related to weather, most frequently rain, winds, clouds, and weather.
